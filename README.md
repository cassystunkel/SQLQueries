# SQLQueries
The SQL project I completed during my CareerFoundry Data Analytics course is based on data for a fictional movie rental company - Rockbuster Stealth LLC. Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to hvae stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. My role in this project as a data analyst was to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.

## Key Questions
- Which movies contributes the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data
The data used for this project was fabricated and provided by CareerFoundry. The data was analyzed using a relational database management system and PostgreSQL. The data set included information on movies in stock, customers, staff, store locations, actors, movie languages, rentals, and replacement costs.

## Visualizations
Tableau Public was used to create the visualizations for this project.
